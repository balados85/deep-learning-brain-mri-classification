# Brain tumor sub-type classification: Performance comparison of Deep learning techniques.(VGG-16, EffificientNetB5, Self Build CNN)
## Description:
Deep learning(DL) techniques such as Neural networks(NN) have been used in identification and classification of cancerous tumours. The area of brain tumours classification based on MRI images is currently receiving research interest. This is because the current method of diagnosis based on histopathological analysis of biopsy specimen is invasive and demands time. Because it is manual it is open to errors making the option to use deep learning to assist early detection all the more important.
